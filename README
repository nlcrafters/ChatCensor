Changelog:

Version 0.20
    Fixed autojail bug
    Fixed iConomy 5 support

Version 0.19
    Made plugin compatible with jail 0.6.1

Version 0.18
    Fixed bug with upper/lower case words not being replaced

Version 0.17
    Fixed bug which caused whole sentence being replaced by 1 word
[spoiler=All Versions]
Version 0.16
    Fixed error after disabling plugin
    Added some code for full regex search (not functional yet)

Version 0.15
    Little changes to iconomy setup (use subtract instead of setbalance)
    If player is fined, but don't have enough balance -> kick
    Forbidden words now have to be at least 3 chars long
    Fixed bug where it could happen that console was spammed with bananas;)
    This had to do with emtpy, or very small 'words' (spaces etc).
    Any 'word' shorter than 3 characters now will be ignored.
    Added one argument to /cc list -> /cc list abc now returns all words containing abc
    Added /cc clearall -> used for clear all words from databae; use with care!

Version 0.14
    Added multiple replacement-words. Instead of only bananas, you can set your
    word-value to bananas,apples,peers It will then take one randomly each time a word is replaced.

Version 0.13
    Added more flexible database libraries. Having a mysql*.jar or sqlite jar in
    your bukkit folder or lib, it will work in both cases, with most mysql versions.
    Fixed bug where newly (/cc add) added words would not be active right away.
    Added better error-handling while accessing iconomy/jail plugins.

Version 0.12
    Broadcast messages also show on console now (player fined/jailed etc).
    Fixed bug in jail/iconomy check. If they were not used, this resulted in errors.
    This plugin now can be used without them without any problems.

Version 0.11
    Fixed bug with jail toggle
    Ignore chat events if the are cancelled (by other plugins).
    Added option to let the jailtime auto-increase by a certain factor
    If the jail-time: 4, the auto-increase-jail-time: 0.5 and a player uses
    a forbidden word for the 10th time, his jailtime will be: (0.5*10) + 4 = 9 mins
    Added /cc reset command to reset playerstats

Version 0.10
    Initial Release
