[B]Changelog:[/B]
Version 0.16 
[LIST]
[*] Fixed error after disabling plugin
[*] Added some code for full regex search (not functional yet)
[/LIST]

Version 0.15 
[LIST]
[*] Little changes to iconomy setup (use subtract instead of setbalance) 
[*] If player is fined, but don't have enough balance -> kick
[*] Forbidden words now have to be at least 3 chars long
[*] Fixed bug where it could happen that console was spammed with bananas;)
    This had to do with emtpy, or very small 'words' (spaces etc). 
    Any 'word' shorter than 3 characters now will be ignored.
[*] Added one argument to /cc list -> /cc list abc now returns all words containing abc
[*] Added /cc clearall -> used for clear all words from databae; use with care!
[/LIST]

Version 0.14 
[LIST]
[*] Added multiple replacement-words. Instead of only bananas, you can set your
word-value to bananas,apples,peers  It will then take one randomly each time a word is replaced. 
[/LIST]
[spoiler=All Versions]
Version 0.13 
[LIST]

    your bukkit folder or lib, it will work in both cases, with most mysql versions.

[*] Added better error-handling while accessing iconomy/jail plugins.
[/LIST]
Version 0.12 
[LIST]

    a forbidden word for the 10th time, his jailtime will be: (0.5*10) + 4 = 9 mins
